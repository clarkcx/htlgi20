My personal schedule for How The Light Gets In
## Friday
### 17:30 — [John Ellis: Exploring the Dark Side of Physics](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/john-ellis-exploring-the-dark-side-of-physics-2002)

Most of the matter and energy in the Universe are in mysterious, invisible forms that cannot be explained by physics as we know it. But there is a way that the dark side of the Universe can be uncovered, and CERN physicist John Ellis knows how.

"The theoretical guru in CERN" ~ Cambridge physicist David Tong

### 19:00 — [DokBox: Breaking the Taboo](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/breaking-the-taboo-2012)

Breaking The Taboo uncovers the UN-sanctioned war on drugs. With exclusive access to the big players of The Global Commission on Drug Policy, the film features former Presidents Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, César Gaviria of Colombia and Fernando Henrique Cardoso.

### 20:00 — [Debate: Power to the people](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/power-to-the-people-2008)

**Julian Baggini, Claire Fox, John McDonnell. Mary Ann Sieghart hosts.**

From Trump to Kim Jong Un, from Putin to Bashar Al-Assad, from the far right to the far left, everyone at least claims to be in favour of democracy. But in what form, and in whose interest? In the West democracy has meant electing others to decide for us. Now, many argue democracy is in trouble. Were we mistaken to imagine that democracy is necessarily progressive and delivers for the people? Could we harness new technologies like blockchain to enable a new, more direct form of democracy that gives everyone a voice? Or is the very idea of giving everyone a say an illusion that leaves us victim to those with power and influence? Democracy is supposed to give power to the people, but how can this be achieved?

Former Brexit Party MEP Claire Fox, Academic Director of the Royal Institute of Philosophy Julian Baggini, and Former Chancellor John McDonnell clash over the future of democracy.
### 23:00 — [DokBox: The Pendle With Child](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/the-pendle-witch-child-2386)

Presented by Simon Armitage, this is an extraordinary story of the most disturbing witch trial in British history and the key role played in it by one nine-year-old girl. Jennet Device was the star witness in the trial of her own mother, her brother, her sister and many of her neighbours. Thanks to her chilling testimony, they were all hanged.

### 11:30 — [Debate: The Mystery of Reality](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/the-mystery-of-reality-2021)

**Jim Baggott, John Ellis, Sabine Hossenfelder. David Malone hosts.**

At the heart of our understanding of reality is physics, the cornerstone of science. But it appears to be in all sorts of trouble. For decades it has been predicted that we would find 'supersymmetry' - a set of parallel particles for all those we currently understand to exist. It was the solution to many inconsistencies and deep puzzles in our current theory. 10,000 scientists collaborated to build The Large Hadron Collider to find the evidence. But year has followed year and no evidence of the predicted supersymmetric particles has been found. Is supersymmetry dead, and with it string theory, the theory of everything, and the life's work of many leading particle physicists? Is our underlying theory, the Standard Model, fundamentally mistaken? Must we conclude that the whole framework of contemporary physics might be wrong? And if so, where can we turn for an alternative?

### 11:30 — [David Nutt: Arc of Life](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/arc-of-life-david-nutt-2126)

**Jim Baggott, John Ellis, Sabine Hossenfelder. David Malone hosts.**

**David Nutt.**

David Nutt is a neuropsychopharmacologist and author who made headlines when he was dismissed from his role as a government advisor after releasing a report stating that alcohol and tobacco were more harmful than LSD, ecstasy and cannabis. David is currently the President of the European Brain Council. Hear him discuss his ideas and experiences in this exclusive extended interview.

### 12:00 — [Philip Goff: The Consciousness Puzzle](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/philip-goff-the-consciousness-puzzle-2024)

Could all matter in the world be conscious? Professor of Philosophy Philip Goff argues that panpyschism is real, and solves the deep problems of materialism and dualism that have plagued philosophy for centuries.

"Suddenly the universe appears in a new and much more revealing perspective." Philip Pullman

### 17:00 — [DokBox: Will a robot steal my job?](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/will-a-robot-steal-my-job-2041)

Anne-Marie Tomchak, science journalist and the UK Editor of Mashable, investigates how robots could be on course to render the skills of much of the world's population obsolete, and asks the question - are any of our jobs safe?

### 18:00 — [Patricia Churchland: The moral brain](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/patricia-churchland-the-moral-brain-2376)

What are the origins of the morals we live by? Pioneering neurophilosopher Patricia Churchland dismisses reason and religion, and traces the roots of conscience to our evolved biology.

### 19:00 — [DokBox: How to see a black hole](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/how-to-see-a-black-hole-2049)

This is the inside story of an international team of scientists as they make history by taking the first ever picture of a black hole. This monumental technological mission takes them to the most powerful telescopes across the world to create one image that will completely transform our understanding of black holes and the universe.

### 19:00 — [John Milbank: The happiness trap](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/john-millbank-the-happiness-trap-2048)

Who doesn't want to be happy? We value that feeling above all else. But renowned theologian John Milbank believes it's time we outgrew this self-centred ideology. Hear him set out his vision for a post-liberal society. "John Milbank is unquestionably among the most sophisticated voices in the whole world of modern theology" - Rowan Williams
