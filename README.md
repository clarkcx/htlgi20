### 17:30 â€” [John Ellis: Exploring the Dark Side of Physics](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/john-ellis-exploring-the-dark-side-of-physics-2002)

Most of the matter and energy in the Universe are in mysterious, invisible forms that cannot be explained by physics as we know it. But there is a way that the dark side of the Universe can be uncovered, and CERN physicist John Ellis knows how.

"The theoretical guru in CERN" ~ Cambridge physicist David Tong
