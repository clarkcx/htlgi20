## Friday
### 17:30 — [John Ellis: Exploring the Dark Side of Physics](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/john-ellis-exploring-the-dark-side-of-physics-2002)

Most of the matter and energy in the Universe are in mysterious, invisible forms that cannot be explained by physics as we know it. But there is a way that the dark side of the Universe can be uncovered, and CERN physicist John Ellis knows how.

"The theoretical guru in CERN" ~ Cambridge physicist David Tong

### 19:00 — [DokBox: Breaking the Taboo](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/breaking-the-taboo-2012)

Breaking The Taboo uncovers the UN-sanctioned war on drugs. With exclusive access to the big players of The Global Commission on Drug Policy, the film features former Presidents Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, César Gaviria of Colombia and Fernando Henrique Cardoso.

### 20:00 — [Debate: Power to the people](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/power-to-the-people-2008)

**Julian Baggini, Claire Fox, John McDonnell. Mary Ann Sieghart hosts.**

From Trump to Kim Jong Un, from Putin to Bashar Al-Assad, from the far right to the far left, everyone at least claims to be in favour of democracy. But in what form, and in whose interest? In the West democracy has meant electing others to decide for us. Now, many argue democracy is in trouble. Were we mistaken to imagine that democracy is necessarily progressive and delivers for the people? Could we harness new technologies like blockchain to enable a new, more direct form of democracy that gives everyone a voice? Or is the very idea of giving everyone a say an illusion that leaves us victim to those with power and influence? Democracy is supposed to give power to the people, but how can this be achieved?

Former Brexit Party MEP Claire Fox, Academic Director of the Royal Institute of Philosophy Julian Baggini, and Former Chancellor John McDonnell clash over the future of democracy.
### 23:00 — [DokBox: The Pendle With Child](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/the-pendle-witch-child-2386)

Presented by Simon Armitage, this is an extraordinary story of the most disturbing witch trial in British history and the key role played in it by one nine-year-old girl. Jennet Device was the star witness in the trial of her own mother, her brother, her sister and many of her neighbours. Thanks to her chilling testimony, they were all hanged.

## Saturday

### 11:30 — [Debate: The Mystery of Reality](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/the-mystery-of-reality-2021)

**Jim Baggott, John Ellis, Sabine Hossenfelder. David Malone hosts.**

At the heart of our understanding of reality is physics, the cornerstone of science. But it appears to be in all sorts of trouble. For decades it has been predicted that we would find 'supersymmetry' - a set of parallel particles for all those we currently understand to exist. It was the solution to many inconsistencies and deep puzzles in our current theory. 10,000 scientists collaborated to build The Large Hadron Collider to find the evidence. But year has followed year and no evidence of the predicted supersymmetric particles has been found. Is supersymmetry dead, and with it string theory, the theory of everything, and the life's work of many leading particle physicists? Is our underlying theory, the Standard Model, fundamentally mistaken? Must we conclude that the whole framework of contemporary physics might be wrong? And if so, where can we turn for an alternative?

### 11:30 — [Arc of Life: David Nutt](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/arc-of-life-david-nutt-2126)

**Jim Baggott, John Ellis, Sabine Hossenfelder. David Malone hosts.**

**David Nutt.**

David Nutt is a neuropsychopharmacologist and author who made headlines when he was dismissed from his role as a government advisor after releasing a report stating that alcohol and tobacco were more harmful than LSD, ecstasy and cannabis. David is currently the President of the European Brain Council. Hear him discuss his ideas and experiences in this exclusive extended interview.

### 12:00 — [Philip Goff: The Consciousness Puzzle](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/philip-goff-the-consciousness-puzzle-2024)

Could all matter in the world be conscious? Professor of Philosophy Philip Goff argues that panpyschism is real, and solves the deep problems of materialism and dualism that have plagued philosophy for centuries.

"Suddenly the universe appears in a new and much more revealing perspective." Philip Pullman

### 17:00 — [DokBox: Will a robot steal my job?](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/will-a-robot-steal-my-job-2041)

Anne-Marie Tomchak, science journalist and the UK Editor of Mashable, investigates how robots could be on course to render the skills of much of the world's population obsolete, and asks the question - are any of our jobs safe?

### 18:00 — [Patricia Churchland: The moral brain](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/patricia-churchland-the-moral-brain-2376)

What are the origins of the morals we live by? Pioneering neurophilosopher Patricia Churchland dismisses reason and religion, and traces the roots of conscience to our evolved biology.

### 19:00 — [DokBox: How to see a black hole](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/how-to-see-a-black-hole-2049)

This is the inside story of an international team of scientists as they make history by taking the first ever picture of a black hole. This monumental technological mission takes them to the most powerful telescopes across the world to create one image that will completely transform our understanding of black holes and the universe.

### 19:00 — [John Milbank: The happiness trap](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/john-millbank-the-happiness-trap-2048)

Who doesn't want to be happy? We value that feeling above all else. But renowned theologian John Milbank believes it's time we outgrew this self-centred ideology. Hear him set out his vision for a post-liberal society. "John Milbank is unquestionably among the most sophisticated voices in the whole world of modern theology" - Rowan Williams

## Sunday

### 11:30 — [Debate: The known and the unknown](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/the-known-and-the-unknown-2068)

**Simon Blackburn, Philip Goff, Renata Salecl. Joanna Kavenna hosts.**

For much of human history people have held firm - if mistaken - beliefs about the nature of the world and the right course of action. But now a steep decline in religious belief, compounded by doubts about the very possibility of objective truth, has left many in the West profoundly lost. Should we welcome this new uncertainty and revel in the absence of a constricting set of agreed beliefs? Are we only now recognising the limitations of the human condition, which our hubris once obscured or denied? Or must we escape from being lost - even if it means adopting illusory certainties - in order to provide social identity, personal well being and purpose?

Renowned philosopher and ethicist Simon Blackburn, psychoanalyst and sociologist Renata Salecl, and author of Galileo's Error: Foundations for a New Science of Consciousness Philip Goff try to find their way through the fog of uncertainty.

### 11:30 — [Debate: The power of the present](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/the-power-of-the-present-2069)

**Danny Penman, Ronald Purser, Meg Rosoff. Brogan Driscoll hosts.**

Celebrities swear by it, scientists study it, monks still practice it and business leaders use it to thwart burnout. Mindfulness, the art of living in the now, has grown hugely in recent years. Its advocates claim it is good for health, reduces stress and improves quality of life. While critics are skeptical that a $4billion industry has our interests truly at heart and challenge the idea that happiness is achievable by all. Is being in the present a vital antidote to a distracted and divisive culture, offering a solution to the misery of humankind? Or has meditation and mindfulness always been a means to hide from the reality of life, peddling fantasy and acquiesence when change and intervention are what is really needed?

Novelist Meg Rosoff, author of McMindfulness Ron Purser and meditation specialist Danny Penman get to the bottom of the mindfulness phenomenon, hosted by HuffPost UK's Brogan Driscoll.

### 14:00 — [Meg Rosoff: A writer's voice](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/meg-rosoff-a-writers-voice-2073)

Do you have a voice? Can you recognise a voice when you hear one? And while we're on the subject, what does "having a voice" actually mean? Award-winning author Meg Rosoff will shine light on the conscious and sub-conscious parts of a writer's voice.

"Like Samuel Beckett on ecstasy" Times

### 14:15 — [Debate: The miracle of the mind](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/the-miracle-of-mind-2074)

**Susan Blackmore, Tim Crane, Bernardo Kastrup. Hilary Lawson hosts**
Despite the advances in neuroscience and the rapidly extending capacity of computers, we still have no adequate theory of consciousness. No account of how the brain is able to create experience. And no account of how the material stuff of the brain can be responsible for thought. Should we conclude that consciousness cannot be explained in terms of the physical? But if so what is the alternative? Or is it just a matter of time, and one day an AI machine will miraculously find itself experiencing the world, and its mere components will have soul?

Metaphysical idealist Bernardo Kastrup, writer and broadcaster Susan Blackmore and philosopher of mind Tim Crane grapple with the origins of consciousness.

### 16:00 — [In conversation: Jim Al-Khalili and Carlo Rovelli](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/in-conversation-carlo-rovell-and-jim-al-khalili-2083)

From pioneering loop quantum gravity, to championing the field of quantum biology, from presenting the BBC's most loved scientific programme, to writing one of the most popular physics books of all time, this pair have done it all. Join physicists Jim Al-Khalili and Carlo Rovelli as they delve into fundamental physics and the nature of reality.

"[Rovelli is] the man who makes physics sexy . . . the scientist they're calling the next Stephen Hawking." The Times Magazine

"Al-Khalili is the Carl Sagan of our generation" Marcus du Sautoy

### 17:00 — [Debate: The AI illusion](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/the-ai-illusion-2085)
**Kate Devlin, Hilary Lawson, Laura Mersini-Houghton, Martin Rees. David Malone hosts**

The world is awash with talk of AI. A third of all companies worldwide claim to be 'have implemented AI in some form', and more than two thirds in the UK and US. But critics argue this is marketing hype. Aritificial Intelligence has not yet happened and there is no sign of it being about to happen. Luc Julia, Samsung's vice president of innovation has stated we have better machines than in the past but they don't involve an artificial form of intelligence. Should we see the future in automation and machine learning and give up on AI? Might this make us feel less scared and more in control of the future? Or is the artificial intelligence revolution not only on its way but already here and changing our world radically for better or worse.

Astronomer Royal and author of On the Future Martin Rees, theoretical physicist Laura Mersini-Houghton, Closure theorist Hilary Lawson and computer scientist Kate Devlin question the reality of artificial intelligence.

### 17:00 — [DokBox: How the MP3 changed music](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/system-shock-how-the-mp3-changed-music-2087)
Germany, 1995. A PhD student makes a technological breakthrough when he discovers how to compress audio without losing sound quality. This is the story of the MP3.


### 18:00 — [David Nutt: Drugs: The case for decriminalisation](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/david-nutt-drugs-the-case-for-decriminalisation-2089)

From Portugal to Canada, more and more countries are decriminalising drugs. Join renowned pharmacologist and former government adviser. David Nutt to hear why the UK should be next. "Any sensible person or scientist knows that the drug laws are not based on the science of drugs." David Nutt

### 19:00 — [Raymond Tallis: The truth about free will](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/raymond-tallis-the-truth-about-free-will-2093)

We are constantly inundated with choices, from what to have for dinner to what to do with our lives. But are we really free to decide, or is choice just an illusion? Cultural critic and philosopher Raymond Tallis unpicks the arguments against the existence of free will.

### 19:45 — [Debate: Getting high and being human](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/getting-high-and-being-human-2095)

**David Nutt, Peter Sjostedt-H, Annemarie Ward. Mark Salter hosts.**

For a century most Western governments have banned recreational drugs other than alcohol and tobacco. Now there are signs of a shift in perception. Canada and many states across the US have legalised the personal use of cannabis - creating a multi-billion dollar business and source of tax revenue. While Portugal decriminalised all drugs 19 years ago with falls in deaths from overdoses and drug related crime. Should we resist this change on the grounds that all drugs are a threat to well being and undermine human experience? Or, is this shift a rational decision about cost and benefits? And might the use of some psychedelic drugs be actually beneficial for our mental health and state of being?

Imperial College psychiatrist and former government drugs adviser David Nutt, philosopher of mind Peter Sjostedt-H, and director of leading addiction and recovery charity Annemarie Ward get to the bottom of getting high.

### 11:00 — [Bernardo Kastrup: The case for Idealism](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/bernardo-kastrup-the-case-for-idealism-2111)

The idea that reality exists outside and independently of the mind seems so obvious as to be indisputable. But is it possible we've all got it completely wrong? Join philosopher, scientist and author of The Idea of the World Bernardo Kastrup as he argues that reality is fundamentally mental.

### 11:00 — [Bernardo Kastrup: The case for Idealism](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/bernardo-kastrup-the-case-for-idealism-2111)

The idea that reality exists outside and independently of the mind seems so obvious as to be indisputable. But is it possible we've all got it completely wrong? Join philosopher, scientist and author of The Idea of the World Bernardo Kastrup as he argues that reality is fundamentally mental.

### 13:00 — [Debate: Beyond material](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/beyond-material-2115)

**Peter Atkins, Nancy Cartwright, Bernardo Kastrup. Barry C Smith hosts.**

The world is only material, only physical stuff - has for a century been the dominant view. Yet science has seemingly eradicated the physical in favour of fields and energy, mathematics and information. More radically quantum physics makes material reality itself unreachable. Meanwhile the intractable problem of how to generate consciousness from material alone is no closer to being solved. Should we as a result embrace the immaterial, as a welcome end to the reductive dogmas of materialist philosophy? Offering an exciting future with the potential for other forms of being and understanding? Or is the immaterial, however understood, necessarily innaccessible, and of no value to our theories and our actions?

Philosopher of science Nancy Cartwright, renowned Oxford Chemist Peter Atkins, and metaphysical idealist Bernardo Kastrup investigate what the world's made of.

### 13:00 — [Debate: The Matrix or the miracle](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/the-matrix-or-the-miracle-2116)

**Theodore Dalrymple, David Pearce, Güneş Taylor. Stephanie Hare hosts.**

Babies need mothers - or so we have always imagined. Yet two scientific breakthroughs in the last couple of years call this fundamental assumption into question. Using only skin cells as their starting point, in 2017 researchers in Japan grew egg cells in the lab, while in the Netherlands scientists claim they are within a decade of creating an artificial womb. Does this technology make babies in the lab a credible outcome, and motherhood and birth potentially unnecessary? Will this lead to a dystopian future, profoundly threatening family life and society as whole? Or should we welcome these new techniques as enabling infertile couples and gay men to have children, and women to avoid the risks and restrictions of pregnancy?

Founder of Humanity+ David Pearce, Francis Crick Institute geneticist Güneş Taylor and cultural critic Theodore Dalrymple clash over genetics, technology and motherhood. 

### 14:00 — [Jim Baggott: The madness of Quantum](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/jim-baggott-the-madness-of-quantum-2117)

Quantum mechanics is completely mad. It stuns us with particles that are waves and waves that are particles. Hear renowned quantum researcher Jim Baggott explain why he still doesn't understand this crazy but integral theory.

### 17:00 — [Debate: The black hole paradox](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/the-black-hole-paradox-2112)

**Sean Carroll, Amelie Saintonge. Anil Ananthaswamy hosts.**

Astronomers last year claimed to have achieved what was thought impossible, and captured an image of a black hole, seemingly proving the existence of these mysterious objects. Yet not everyone is convinced.  Black holes are so described because they were proposed as a space from which nothing can escape. At the heart of the black hole physics seemed to come to an end, its laws in tatters. Stephen Hawking, having been the first to propose black holes, at the end of his life came to argue that they did not exist - at least in the sense in which they were first described.  

Is the idea of a black hole from which nothing can escape a mistake? If so, how can we resolve the paradox that they were predicted by a combination of relativity and quantum mechanics? Or should we hold onto the idea of black holes, however mysterious and problematic they are?
