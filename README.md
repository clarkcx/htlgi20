### 17:30 — [John Ellis: Exploring the Dark Side of Physics](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/john-ellis-exploring-the-dark-side-of-physics-2002)

Most of the matter and energy in the Universe are in mysterious, invisible forms that cannot be explained by physics as we know it. But there is a way that the dark side of the Universe can be uncovered, and CERN physicist John Ellis knows how.

From Trump to Kim Jong Un, from Putin to Bashar Al-Assad, from the far right to the far left, everyone at least claims to be in favour of democracy. But in what form, and in whose interest? In the West democracy has meant electing others to decide for us. Now, many argue democracy is in trouble. Were we mistaken to imagine that democracy is necessarily progressive and delivers for the people? Could we harness new technologies like blockchain to enable a new, more direct form of democracy that gives everyone a voice? Or is the very idea of giving everyone a say an illusion that leaves us victim to those with power and influence? Democracy is supposed to give power to the people, but how can this be achieved?

Former Brexit Party MEP Claire Fox, Academic Director of the Royal Institute of Philosophy Julian Baggini, and Former Chancellor John McDonnell clash over the future of democracy.
### 23:00 — [DokBox: The Pendle With Child](https://howthelightgetsin.org/events/the-pendle-witch-child-2386)

**Julian Baggini, Claire Fox, John McDonnell. Mary Ann Sieghart hosts.**

Presented by Simon Armitage, this is an extraordinary story of the most disturbing witch trial in British history and the key role played in it by one nine-year-old girl. Jennet Device was the star witness in the trial of her own mother, her brother, her sister and many of her neighbours. Thanks to her chilling testimony, they were all hanged.
